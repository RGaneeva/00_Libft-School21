# LIBFT

School-21 (Ecole42) 'libft' project. Score 100/100

Library on C language with my own realization of some C standard library functions.

In this project, I have implemented the following functions: isalpha, isdigit, isalnum, isascii, isprint, strlen, memset, bzero, memcpy, memmove, strlcpy, strlcat, toupper, tolower, strchr, strrchr, strncmp, memchr, memcmp, strnstr, atoi, calloc, strdup, substr, strjoin, strtrim, split, itoa, strmapi, striteri, putchar_fd, putstr_fd, putendl_fd, putnbr_fd.

This project is a starter at School 21 and it is the basis for writing the following several projects (implementation of the get_next_line and printf functions, Fdf and Cub3d projects). It is a part of our acquaintance with the C language, its capabilities and functionality
